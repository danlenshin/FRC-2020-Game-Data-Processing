# FIRST-Robotics-2020-Game-Data-Processing
An Excel spreadsheet with macros to automatically process competition data at matches of FIRST Infinite Recharge

Created by Daniel Lenshin for Gryphon Robotics

The Excel workbook is two spreadsheets; the first spreadsheet, "Processed Data," is where information is displayed in the form of averages and percentages. the second spreadsheet, "Data Input," is where data for every match is inputted.

In the Processed Data spreadsheet, the user should fill out the columns under "Team Data" with the team numbers, and information about the robots. **You must enter the team numbers**, as these are how the program identifies the teams. There should also be no gaps between the numbers, or else the code will only process team values until the first gap. 

In the Data Input spreadsheet, the user should fill out one row to represent a single team's performance during a single match. Each performance is a new row, and there should be no gaps between the rows. 

Two sample spreadsheets, for the Chesapeake Bethesda competition and for the Chesapeake Edgewater competition have been created and uploaded for demonstrative purposes. Other teams attending these competitions are welcome to use these spreadsheets. 

Good luck to everyone during the 2020 season!
